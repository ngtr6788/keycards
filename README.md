# "Keycards"

Keycards is a working title for an ongoing medium-sized project I'm working on, mostly for
myself.

I'm aiming for a flashcard app to learn keyboard shortcuts, and as of December 24th, 2021,
it's more of a keyboard pop quiz right now. Heck, it's not working that properly right now.

TL;DR: It's a work-in-progress keyboard shortcut testing app.

I'm experimenting this app a little by publishing it on GitHub just to see if it still works.
Apologies if it's not working right now. However, if you want to play around, here you go.
