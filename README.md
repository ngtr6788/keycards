# "Keycards"

Keycards is a working title for an ongoing medium-sized project I'm working on, mostly for
myself.

I'm aiming for a flashcard app to learn keyboard shortcuts, and as of December 24th, 2021,
it's more of a keyboard pop quiz right now. (Heck, it's not working that properly right now. EDIT: As of Jan 1st, 2022, I tested with React Testing Library and it's working fine now.)

TL;DR: It's a work-in-progress keyboard shortcut testing app.

I'm experimenting this app a little by publishing it on GitHub just to see if it still works.
Apologies if there are a few bugs here and there. I'll get into it. However, if you want to play around, here you go.

# Wishlist

There are things that I really want to add (a wishlist, if you will):

- Rework the parameter on the Flashcard "API"
  - Learn Redux. (DONE?)
  - Improved on the Flashcard "API" (DONE!)
- Revamp the help screen. It sucks. I know. (Improved a little better, keep working on it)
- Learn Bootstrap and integrate it with this app. (DONE! EASY)
- Add more tests as I add newer components. (DONE and CONTINUE...)
- Add way to custom-build flashcard decks. (DONE? UI only)
- Learn Make this website more accessible, and rewrite some of the tests based on that (Gosh that is harder than I thought for this app)
- What the heck are those back end stuff? Teach me.
- Somehow, find a way to integrate Leitner system or add a learn
  option or something.
