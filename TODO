There are things that I really want to add:
- Rework the parameter on the Flashcard "API"
- Revamp the help screen. It sucks. I know.
- Learn Bootstrap and integrate it with this app.
- Somehow, find a way to integrate Leitner system or add a learn
option or something.
- Add more tests probably related to the specific types of
flashcards, apparently.
- What the heck are those back end stuff? Teach me.
